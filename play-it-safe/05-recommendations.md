### Security Recommendations for Botium Toys

#### Introduction
The Internal Security Audit identified several significant security vulnerabilities in Botium Toys; these vulnerabilities present a risk of unauthorized access to Botium Toys and expose the organization to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and disruption of operations. 
The following represents the recommendations made following the Internal Security Audit findings based on risk severity and potential impact on the company based on a business perspective.

---
#### Summary of High-Risk Issues
The Internal Security Audit found the following high-risk issues:

- The enforcement of least privilege access is not in place
- No backup or disaster recovery plans
- Weak password policies and credential management practices
- No segregation of duties in place
- Sensitive data and cardholder data stored in unencrypted format
- No intrusion detection system (IDS) in place
- Insufficient protection of personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII) 
- Non-compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR

#### Recommendations
### 1. Implement a Least Privilege Access Policy
Restricting access to systems and sensitive information to employees who need access in order to perform their job responsibilities (also known as a "Need to Know" basis) will lessen the risk associated with unauthorized access and/or compromised accounts.

### 2. Strengthen Password Policies and Credential Management
A centralized password management program should be implemented to enforce strong passwords (ie., passwords must be at least a certain number of characters long, complex, must be changed periodically, etc.) to reduce the risk of credential compromise.

### 3. Create and Test Disaster Recovery Plans
Documented disaster recovery/business continuity plans to restore systems/data after a cyber attack, system failure, or other event. Testing of plans should occur on a regular basis to ensure/validate their effectiveness.

### 4. Separate Job Functions
Critical job functions should be assigned to more than one person in order to reduce the possibility of internal fraud, misuse of the computer system, or unauthorized use of sensitive information such as socially identifiable and sensitive personal information.

### 5. Protect Sensitive Data with Encryption
All sensitive information (customer payment information and data that has previously been stored) should be encrypted both while at rest and while in transit. Encryption will provide protection against unauthorized access, as well as satisfy the requirements of PCI DSS and GDPR.

### 6. Implement an Intrusion Detection System
Implementing an intrusion detection system will allow the organization to monitor the network for suspicious/malicious activity and generate alerts. This will enhance the organization's ability to detect and respond to a security incident.


### 7. Automate and Protect Backup Processes
Backup of critical data must occur on a routine basis, and backups should be stored in a secure location. This will reduce the risks of losing data and increase the speed of restoration after cyber incidents or equipment failure.

### 8. Schedule Regular Maintenance for Legacy Systems
Establish a repeating plan for evaluating, modifying, and maintaining legacy systems. Creating procedures to follow in the case of system changes allows for clearly defined actions to decrease security exposure from outdated systems.

### 9. Enhance Data Privacy Protocol for Customers in the E.U.
Improve compliance with E.U.-based data privacy laws by implementing enhanced encryption protocols, limiting customer data access, and ensuring that customer data breach notification protocols are consistently followed.

### 10. Define and Enforce User Access Protocols
Define and implement user access protocols to limit access to sensitive data and systems to authorized users only.

### 11. Improve Protection of Sensitive Data
Strengthen protections for personal identifiable information (PII), sensitive personal identifiable information (SPII), and all other business-related sensitive data to reduce exposure and provide a higher level of regulatory protection for these data.

Conclusion
The risks outlined above must be addressed by Botium Toys through immediate implementation of the best-practice recommendations and ongoing periodic audits to monitor progress and to promote continued improvement to the security posture of Botium Toys.
